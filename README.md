# Object-Oriented Programming
In this repo, I saved the codes I wroted while trying my hands on `Python OOP` as I improved and learned more by practicing. I have learned, by experience, to deliberately keep track of my progress as I grow, so I decided to save these works here. I was still a student of ALX SWE by the time this repo was created
